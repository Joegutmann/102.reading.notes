## What is the BIOS?

–Basic input output system. A part of the system that loads the operating system in conjunction with CMOS. BIOS is firmware which is imbedded into the hardware of the computer to enable it to aid in the starting processes of numerous parts of the computer on initialization of the system. The computers CPU upon being powered on, runs BIOS as the first program. BIOS then loads the Operating System, and works through its checklist to configure hardware, cmos setup utility, etc before handing off control to the operating system.

## Use analogies from your previous background to explain what happens during the booting process?

–I was originally going to say it was like a spark plug in a car, but chatgpt corrected me and informed me that it is closer to the Engine Control Unit or Engine Control Module in modern cars.

## What is the “Power On Self Test”?

–A task performed by the BIOS to ensure all the essential hardware like RAM, CUP, storage devices, graphics cards etc are functioning correctly. If it is not, it will beep at you to let you know it failed.

## What is the CMOS battery?

–It is the battery that powers the CMOS and allows it to retain the BIOS settings, even when the computer is shut off. It is on the motherboard, and supplies power to CMOS RAM.

## Things I want to know more about

–How to manipulate these systems for work in Cyber Security.
